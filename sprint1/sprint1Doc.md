	[relevant commit](https://github.com/jaredwelch1/softwareEngFinalProj/commit/4c96a5cc3606886cc53841bfe110d25a5663538d)

	This page [https://mizzou.tech/view.php](https://mizzou.tech/view.php) shows a successful query to our database to show that it exists and has some data. 

	Just for proof, the code for that page can be found here:
	
	[link](https://github.com/jaredwelch1/softwareEngFinalProj/blob/master/webPages/view.php)
	
	The page shows a valid query that is run when the page is loaded, verifying and displaying our data.

	Further, here is a link to the script that was used to create our tables:
