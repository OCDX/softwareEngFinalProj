#Tables and their data:

	|User|
	-----------
	| 	Username <br> Password <br> IDs for manifests by this user <br> test |

	|Manifest Search Data|
	-----------
	| Title <br> contributors <br> SNC search tags <br> related categories|

	**NOTE: this is a first pass, will need to think more and gather more information in this. 
	For example, it might not be useful to have search tags in the database itself, 
	maybe that is a different type of data**

	|Manifest Data|
	------------
	| Owner <br> User Accesses <br> time of upload <br> time of last change <br> version <br> dataset (json? not sure) <br> SNC files (if present) |
