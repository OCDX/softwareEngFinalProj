#Testing Explanation

We are using a tool called Jmeter, which allows you to create testing plans for various types of software.

Our primary focus in using this tool is to run database and web page tests.

In order to run our tests, you must have Java installed and Jmeter installed. 

Once you have those things, you can simply download the tester file and upload it to Jmeter. Then you can run the test and see the results.
