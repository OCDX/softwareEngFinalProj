	Jared
	
- [ ] fix requirements analysis 

	Jared

- [ ] Stub calls (in our case, we just need to organize the pages, and create space for the calls that will be used within those pages)
	
	Liz
	
- [ ] Begin organization of UI elements 
	
	* This will require two things: 
			* Make sure our page design doc reflects the overall lay out of each UI element that will be in place
			* Make sure that the elements are described in detail with what their purpose is for a user

- [ ] Manage users and roles

	Andrew

	* Create document that outlines what users our system has and their access
		
	* Maybe begin log in and log out? Might not need for this sprint
